# stylegan3
NVidia's StyleGan series of papers and models aims at generating synthetic images from real images with controled modifications.
Applications are in photo edition (photoshop like), domain translation (winter to summer, old to young, etc.) and video generation.
It is done by AI and ANN. The NN learn from a set of images (faces, fish, beaches, flowers, beds, etc).
