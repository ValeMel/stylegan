# stylegan3
NVidia's StyleGan series of papers and models aim at generating synthetic images from real images with controled modifications.
Applications are in photo edition (photoshop like), domain translation (winter to summer, old to young, etc.) and video generation.
It is done by AI and ANN. The NN learns from a set of images (faces, fish, beaches, flowers, beds, etc).

StyleGAN enabled to build an image as a hierarchical synthesis. This was enabled by disentanglement. Disentanglement was obtained among others through progressively growing GANs.
